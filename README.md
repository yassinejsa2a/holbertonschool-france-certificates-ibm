# IBM Certifications Repository

Welcome to my IBM Certifications Repository! This repository serves as a central hub for storing and showcasing all the certifications I obtain through IBM's certification system.

## Purpose

This repository is designed to:

* Organize and track my progress in IBM certifications.
* Provide easy access to my achieved certifications.
* Serve as a reference for my professional growth in IBM-related technologies.

## Structure

Each certification will be stored in a dedicated folder, structured as follows:

```
.
├── README.md
└── certificates-trimester-1
    └── certificate-oss.png
```

## Certifications List

| Certification Name  | Date Obtained   | Badge |
| :--------------------- |:-------------------:| -----:|
| Example Certification  |   DD-MM-YYYY        |  Aligné à droite |



## How to Use This Repository

* Navigate through the folders to view individual certifications.
* Open the README file inside each certification folder for detailed information about the course/exam.
* Use this repository as a portfolio to showcase IBM-related expertise.
